1. In the terminal and within the project directory run 'npm install'
2. Run npm start to start the server, which will be at localhost:2222
3. I used postman to verify all of my solutions and checked the response times in the console to ensure the cache was functioning properly
4. step 1 solution will be found at localhost:2222/api/ping
